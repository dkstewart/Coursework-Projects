  | I can't reproduce this error.

For me it is very repeatable... (like every time, without fail).

This is the debug log of the pick happening ...

18:19:03 Pick_It {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequence mercury}
18:19:03 exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequence mercury
18:19:04 Ftoc_PickMsgs {{1 hit}}
18:19:04 Marking 1 hits
18:19:04 tkerror: syntax error in expression "int ...

Note, if I run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace  4852-4852 -sequence mercury
1 hit

That's where the "1 hit" comes from (obviously).  The version of nmh I'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compiled on fuchsia.cs.mu.OZ.AU at Sun Mar 17 14:55:56 ICT 2002]

And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list


Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

kre

ps: this is still using the version of the code form a day ago, I haven't
been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue I think).

Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek sculptor behind the plan, judged that the
 limestone of Mount Kerdylio, 70 miles east of Salonika and not far from the
 Mount Athos monastic community, was ideal for the patriotic sculpture. 
 
 As well as Alexander's granite features, 240 ft high and 170 ft wide, a
 museum, a restored amphitheatre and car park for admiring crowds are
planned
---------------------
So is this mountain limestone or granite?
If it's limestone, it'll weather pretty fast.

Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow 

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

Klez: The Virus That Won't Die
 
Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.

Andrew Brandt
>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002


The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.

Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.

And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
the docs for (n)mh for all the details.

There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
to "syntax" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).

And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...
somewhere at rtfm.mit.edu... ok, here we go:
rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/news.answers/signature_finger_faq.
(Warning... it's old, May 1995).

Hope this helps.

I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a 
recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it 
works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe 
for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan) 
except for the creme fraiche.

Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta, 
really)? You mix in the raw egg to the cooked pasta and the heat of the pasta 
cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

The Scotsman - 22 August 2002

 Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
 
 
 AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
 his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
 (£160,000). 
 
 Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
 said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
 young woman - preferably under 30. 
 
 "I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
 me gets all the money," Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
 
 "I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
 fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
 end with a heart attack and then I’m gone." 
 
 Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
 sent in quickly because of his age. "It could end very soon," he said.

You're probably right, mine's just the same but with the cream added to the 
eggs.  I guess I should try it without.  Actually looking on the internet for a 
recipe I found this one from possibly one of the scariest people I've ever seen, 
and he's a US Congressman:
<http://www.virtualcities.com/ons/me/gov/megvjb1.htm>

That's one of the worst non-smiles ever.

 Meaningful sentences 
 
 Tracey Lawson 
 
 
 If you ever wanted to look like "one of the most dangerous inmates in prison
 history", as one judge described Charles Bronson, now’s your chance. Bronson -
 the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and
 fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary
 muscle power. 
 
 Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,
 has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he
 has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a
 day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at
 virtually no cost. 
 
 The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a
 fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and
 starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the
 exercise industry. 
 
 "I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it," is the
 opening paragraph penned by Bronson. "It’s a joke and a big con and they call
 me a criminal!" You can’t help feeling he has a point. 
 
 This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having
 already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems
 created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to
 discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure. 
 
 Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents
 when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison’s famous special unit, which aimed to
 help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to
 express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the
 murder of "Babs" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he
 has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was
 published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an
 award-winning film. 
 
 Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in
 Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison
 officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being
 transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and
 developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,
 a frank account of Glasgow’s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received
 critical praise. 
 
 And Lord Archer doesn’t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books
 that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book
 deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt
 scribbling away as we speak. 
 
 So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so
 destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck
 on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronson’s publisher, has published many books
 about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both
 pragmatic and profound. 
 
 He says: "Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have
 known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the
 chance to focus on their creative skills. 
 
 "It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an
 education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time
 anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents." 
 
 However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:
 "Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine
 the very essence of who they are. 
 
 "They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or
 am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something
 good?" 
 
 Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that
 of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered
 mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed
 robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term
 over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was
 jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly
 two days during a jail siege. 
 
 Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is
 renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands
 and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: "I can hit
 a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds." 
 
 But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary
 Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson’s face sitting on every
 coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which
 so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because
 Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. 
 
 "All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it’s just a load of
 bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket," he writes, in what can only be
 described as a refreshingly honest style. "We can all be fat lazy bastards,
 it’s our choice, I’m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff
 your face with shit you become shit, that’s logical to me." 
 
 As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside
 we all needed. 
 
 
 Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will
 be available in bookstores from October at £7.99

hmmm, I stole the code from unseenwin, but I never tested it since I don't use 
that functionality.  Consider it on my list of things to check.

I have been trying to research via SA mirrors and search engines if a canned
script exists giving clients access to their user_prefs options via a
web-based CGI interface. Numerous ISPs provide this feature to clients, but
so far I can find nothing. Our configuration uses Amavis-Postfix and ClamAV
for virus filtering and Procmail with SpamAssassin for spam filtering. I
would prefer not to have to write a script myself, but will appreciate any
suggestions.

  | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
  | color in the ftoc.

That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.

I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.

  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
  | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.

OK.

  | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
  | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.

In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
"all unknown" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)


  | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?

  | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar.   I ended up using

*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.

Yes - great minds think alike. But even withput eval rules it would be very 
useful. It would allow us to respond quickly to spammer's tricks.

 Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.

 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.

 Woohoo.

I've done this.  It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.  
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the 
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.

I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new 
functionality I'm going to add for a while.  Also, I now have pretty much 
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much 
done.  I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and 
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

Chris

SpamAssassin is hurting democracy!
Owen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

for the Los Angeles Times.

Hi all,

apologies for the possible silly question (i don't think it is, but), 
but is Eircom's aDSL service NAT'ed?

and what implications would that have for VoIP? I know there are 
difficulties with VoIP or connecting to clients connected to a NAT'ed 
network from the internet wild (i.e. machines with static, real IPs)

any help pointers would be helpful,

cheers

There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT 
listers were approached by him (via email) - a little research in 
dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly 
hoping to contact girls, appearing in "alt.teens" and similar groups -
 I just tried a Google Groups search on "Robert Moaby" and some of 
them came top of the list.

Note for Marie - "MT" stands for Mark Thomas, a slightly slimmer, UK 
version of your Michael Moore - the mailing list is named after him.

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

Why do you say Dell is cheaper than DNUK?

It gets a bit complicated though!

When I'd read that "getting legal title
can take 20 years", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them "development" free.

Now, it may be that "Manhattanites' view
of America" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks.  But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.

So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.

The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to "introduce market mechanisms".  It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.

What happened to more highly-capitalized
land?  Putting in trees instead of crops
sounds like it might sidestep that.

On the "to find" list.  Any chance of
an explanation of that "Bell Jar" in
the meantime?

Hi everybody!

I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 
access with postgreSQL).

This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 
framework for other web applications.

The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.

I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 
database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.

Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.

A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 
encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 
and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. 

I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 
the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the 
database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 
Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 
database password, I can use a different database with different 
user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.

Where I can found good documentation about this topic?

There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 
thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 
After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 
learn methods and technics.

First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 
I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 
could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 
(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 
nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 
or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.

The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 
the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 
bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 
is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 
db connection/password to the main web application.

In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 
shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 
account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 
provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 
application (that means, really, another server running in the 
background).

Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Mario Torre

This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts 
much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will 
just be ignored I think.  You do seem to have changed the 
logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify 
immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the 
code and couldn't fully make out how it had changed.  I think we 
want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there 
somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff?  For 
the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently 
(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have 
immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

Shouldn't be a problem.  Assuming I can get the darned thing to 
compile :)

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).

However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.

I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.

Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.

I hope this helps some.

Thanks Paul,
That is the way I am doing right now, but I would like to NOT use the mouse 
for such things. Any other clue?

Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.

 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,
Peter

Just got this ... I was just reading mail, but in a very dark
room, where the keyboard is illuminated mostly by the light from
the (laptop) screen.   I think I put my fingers on the wrong keys.
(I mostly use the keyboard exclusively while running exmh).

This is from today's cvs (the fixes for the problems I mentioned
yesterday are included) - I eventually managed to contact the cvs
server.

kre

ps: I have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal, and the
"colours from the ftoc" stuff all deleted, and it is looking just about as
good as the old unseen window used to look.   I still have some work to
do to make it a little nicer (listboxes seem to have some strange habits)
and then I need to make it all optional and parameterized, at the minute
I'm just embedding stuff in the code, much quicker for prototyping.  Once
its done, I'll send a patch for someone to look over.

The best I can think of is to figure out what the command being 
issued by exmh is that selects and inserts the sig and bind that to a 
key sequence.  That shouldn't be *too* difficult, it's just a matter 
of figuring out the tcl (something my perl-based brain isn't excited 
about :)

Why wait until you're dead? I'm sure there's enough carbon in
the fat from your typical liposuction job to make a decent diamond.

Update on this for anyone that's interested, and because I like closed 
threads... nothing worse than an infinite while loop, is there?

I ended up formatting a floppy on my flatmate's (un-networked) P100 running 
FAT16 Win95, and mcopied the contents of the bootdisk across. Now I have a 
FAT16 Win98 install running alongside Slackware, and can play Metal Gear 
Solid when the mood takes me ;)

Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.

Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.

==========

I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)

==>

The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...

De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.

is the envy of most of the world.

Has anyone seen/heard of/used some package that would let a random person 
go to a webpage, create a mailing list, then administer that list.  Also 
of course let ppl sign up for the lists and manage their subscriptions. 
Similar to the old listbot.org, but i'd like to have it running on my 
server not someone elses :)

~sigh~  I'd already found that and checked it in....apparently I did so after 
you checked it out and before you sent this mail...I hoped I was fast enough 
that you wouldn't see it.

Try again!

An apparent quote from Dubya, from the Times (sent to me by my Dad):

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.

Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

Works like a charm. It's like the box was on drugs or something. 

However, while testing it a selected my favourite folder (l-k) and 
marked ~400 messages unread. THAT took forever, or about as long as 
Catch-up Unseen did before. Any suggestions?

Hi,

Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
tutorials in the ibm developer connection.

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1

and

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2

Registration is needed.

I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
suggested by someone.

For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).

I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
implementation at anytime.

Thank you again!

Mario Torre

That's fixed now.  I thought I'd caught all the occurrences of that particular 
coding stupidity.

And will run Solaris 9 when Sun catch up with the x86 drivers and kernel.

Although don't hold your breath for the free DVD. It will never come.

(Spot the person who applied for the free Solaris 9 DVD, only to be told
three months later it is no longer available.<mutter>)

FWIW Solaris and Linux seem to be getting closer all the time. I can no
longer see any specific reason why one is better than the other. Expect Red
Hat Solaris 11 any time now... <grin>

http://www.snopes.com/quotes/bush.htm

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, "The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur."

Status:   False.

Origins:   Yet another French fried "George W. Bush is dumb"
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. "The problem with the
French," Bush afterwards confided in Blair, "is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur."

The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed "my good friend Tony Blair" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. "I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,"
Campbell told The Post. "If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke."

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the "village idiot" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.

Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
or less?

Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the 
time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get 
on TV.  Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to 
get information.

but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool for
dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.

So some guy failed to reach the source, but instead got spin doctor to
deny it.  Wot, is he thick enough to expect official confirmation
that, yes, Blair is going around casting aspersions on Bush???

It's an amusing anecdote, I don't know if it's true or not, but certainly
nothing here supports the authoritative sounding conclusion "Status: False".

That depends on how the list is collected, or
even on what the senders say about how the list
is collected. Better to just put it on a website,
and that way it can be surfed anonymously. AND
it doesn't clutter my inbox.

I actually thought it was pretty funny and quite accurate.  Who cares if the spinmeisters are denying it?

So thats the trick, just let any anecdotal utterances you LIKE be deemed
true until proven false, and then hold other data to the opposite
standard...

Yeah, I see how that could be a handy tool RH.

hmmm.

Peter.

Open a terminal and as root type
lsmod
you want to find a module called
NVdriver.

If it isn't loaded then load it.
#insmod NVdriver.o
Oh and ensure you have this module loaded on boot.... else when you reboot
you might be in for a nasty surprise.

Once the kernel module is loaded

#vim /etc/X11/XF86Config

in the section marked
Driver I have "NeoMagic"
you need to have
Driver "nvidia"

Here is part of my XF86Config

Also note that using the card you are using you 'should' be able to safely
use the FbBpp 32 option .

According to my son, it was actually Homer Simpson, who claimed the 
French had no word for victory.

Exsqueeze me, but what part of "I don't know if it's true or not"
did you fail to grok?  I personally doubt it simply because I never
heard of Bush and Chirac going to Brighton.

Next time I hear a joke, I promise not to laugh until I have checked
out primary sources for confirmation in triplicate, OK?  Good thing
we have you around to keep us on the straight and narrow, all the while
inundating us with such erudite profundities as "Kill your idols folks",
"fight the powers that be, from with out and from with in" and innumerable
other dippy bromides.

Actually it doesn't say that they did, just that Blair spoke to

This wouldn't be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up
in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.
Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the "alsa-driver" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packages

Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.

Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a "one size fits all" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that "one size fits many" then if you want ;-)

Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

It will function as a router if that is what you wish.

It even looks like the modem's embedded OS is some kind of linux, being that
it has interesting interfaces like eth0.

I don't use it as a router though.... I just have it do the absolute minimum
DSL stuff and do all the really fun stuff like pppoe on my linux box........

Also the manual tells you what the default password is.

Don't forget to run pppoe over the alcatel speedtouch 350i as in my case you
'HAVE TO' have a bridge configured in the router/modem's software........
This lists your VCI values etc.

There's lots of similar places.  Saskatchewan, for example, once
shared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the
hundred-thousand-hectares).

It's still curious Iceland leads.  Maybe there's just a deep cultural
curiousity and fascination with watching advertising from the rest of
the world. Maybe they're downloading Bjork videos.

A.K. Dewdney was the name I was looking for and the column was "Computer

I have to agree here.  If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not
support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.

A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all
its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.

Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor
of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

Sorry, that just can't work.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,
and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.

Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.

Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for "internet postage stamps" that
everybody has to pay them for.

The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.

[*] And I use the term "they" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.

Is there a way to look for a particular file or directory in 100's of zip
files??
Something like zgrep but for the filename instead of a word

Thanks Justin

probably there are more elegant solutions, but if your zips are in one
directory you can do something like

for i in *.zip
do
if unzip -v $i | grep -q FILEYOUWANT
then
~  echo $i
fi
done

That 1 is unneeded and is probably whats upsetting your kernel

we use "console=ttyS0,9600n8" but the 9600 is mainly cos we are a cisco
shop and its to keepo everyhting the same.

Not true on the choice part.

After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want
their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.

I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....

Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I
wanted....................................

All,

Is it just me or has there been a massive increase in the amount of email 
being falsely bounced around the place? I've already received email from a 
number of people I don't know, asking why I am sending them email. These 
can be explained by servers from Russia and elsewhere. Coupled with the 
false emails I received myself, it's really starting to annoy me. Am I the 
only one seeing an increase in recent weeks?

Martin

This is happening due to insufficient write access to the
"razor-agent.log" file. I was getting the same error, but
only as a non-root user.  As a quick workaround, you can do
"chmod go+w razor-agent.log".

In Agent.pm, when then the Logger object is created, it
doesn't check whether the logfile is writable by the current
user. Then, when a write attempt is made, it bails out with
the "unblessed reference" error.

Hope that helps,
Michael

Thanks Matthias.  Actually I got all four speakers with subwoofer
working in digital out mode with gamixer.
(http://www1.tcnet.ne.jp/fmurata/linux/down/)

However switching between analog and digital, I'm still baffled.  As I
have a tuner and cassette deck hooked up to "Line In" on a SBLive! 5.1,
which is in analog mode.  But digital out works great now!

I am wondering whether there's a way that I can use sitescooper and/or plucker
or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit
more palmos friendly?

I don't have a Windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;
I know that if this were not the case, in Word I could save them as some
other more friendly format.

razor-agents 2.14 needs all parts to be spam to make a positive decision
(though this will change with the next release), so it couldn't have been
a background. Could you send me the debug log?

cheers,

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to
postscript and png.  You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you
have x installed.

This is a standard trap for people building things from source. It's
generally wise to have a special "build" environment to avoid these
hassles. Most likely you have some library loading path in your env. An
strace of the app will show it:

	the-app 2>&1 | grep dude

Personally, I have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to
start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The
prevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.

Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.

also there's catdoc and wv for Word --> text conversions.  actually, wv
consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says "converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW".  HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)

don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, "the more the merrier". ;-)

AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the "Save As" dialog box.

Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

anyways...

                               stiffening sinews

         More hot summer days in the mailinglist alleyways,
         dangerously empty of sane postings, strewn with the rotting
         carcasses of broiling vacation messages. Hacktress and
         Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts
         about a new open 802.11 network she's found. "I am here at
         the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I
         would check to see if there is connectivity", she writes,
         somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list. Exit
         the rest of the Wifi community through the nearest window
         and out into the streets... where, cooling tempers, the
         Microsoft Palladium boys are on an endless summer tour,
         reassuring the experts that while, hmm, they *suppose* Pd
         could *theoretically* be used as a Hollywood DRM system,
         they truly have no plans to do any such thing. Cypherpunk
         and friend of freedom Lucky Green hears this; thinks up four
         or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends
         them off to be patented in his name. Licensing funds, we
         imagine, will go on cracking his own DRMs. And so the mail
         loops on.

         Could Lucky get himself arrested under the DMCA for
         distributing a circumvention device? Worse: now we have the
         EUCD incoming, could he here in the UK? Will Alan Cox go to
         jail for posting detailed Changelogs? Will even the nicest
         UK cryptographer (or curious garage tinkerer) find
         themselves hauled up under our new and scarily DMCAish
         copyright regime? Find out the facts at the free FAIR DEAL
         FOR COPYRIGHT conference, organised by the irrepressible
         FOUNDATION FOR INFORMATION POLICY RESEARCH for Wednesday
         2002-09-18 at the London School of Economics. All the usual
         fun from the creators of the Scrambling for Safety crypto
         cons: we confidently predict government spokesmen caught in
         headlights, wanton Dave Bird heckling, some industry bigwig
         fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other
         epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker
         ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme
         Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We
         suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's
         job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for
         a day). They say there's some rule that would break, though.
         http://www.fipr.org/vacancy.html
- doesn't the Foundation use psychohistory for filling these positions?

         For those of us who can't read the abbreviation EULA without 
         thinking of Martian fighting machines and their "deafening 
         howls... which roared like thunder", we're sorry to report 
         that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR 
         OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to "health and safety 
         issues". The event was to feature computer graphics, 
         fireworks, "60ft-tall Martian fighting machines" wreaking 
         "havoc and destruction", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
         possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with 
         Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at 
         Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new 
         venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original 
         invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety 
         issues, "slain after all man's devices had failed by the 
         humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this 
         earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. For, directly 
         the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies 
         attacked them..."

         and engage with real-world notions of editorial quality surely 
         has to be a good thing. Our only disappointment is that The 
         Guardian appears to be focussing on the "best" of the entries, 
         when everyone knows the real fun is to be had cruising the 
         truly terrible examples that the genre has to offer, mentally 
         allocating points for "Most Depressing Recycling Of Daypop Top

          The respective trademark holders will hate this, but
          Windows really *is* like the Sun. You have this big hulking
          mass of concentrated power in the middle, with a few small
          orbiting utilities - like WinZip, and PuTTY, and VNC.
          Occasionally one will get a bit too close to the OS, and
          Microsoft will suck it down and turn it into fuel for the
          System. One such discrete satellite remains FILEZILLA, the
          still-necessary ftp gui client for Windows. Those who know
          it won't need the introduction, although they might
          appreciate the note that it's getting close to v2.0 time.
          For dogged WS_FTP users, though, it's got multiple
          downloads, auto-restart of interrupted 'loads, queuing, and
          sftp and Kerberos support. It's also GPL'd which makes it a

  Gaim Changelog
    http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog

Gaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC
protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client
that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the
hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an
untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,
permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users
machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the
user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't
vulnerable.

The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser
command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will
need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'
browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the
'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from
the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar
in the buddy list window.

Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also
obtain this update from the Ximian FTP site.

There were four buddies golfing and the first guy said, "I had to
promise my wife that I would paint the whole outside of the house
just to go golfing."

The second guy said, "I promised my wife that I would remodel the
kitchen for her."

The third guy said, "You guys have it easy! I promised my wife that
I would build her a new deck." They continued to play the hole.
Then the first guy said to the fourth guy, "What did you have to
promise your wife?"

The fourth guy replied, "I didn't promise anything." All the guys
were shocked, "How did you do it?!" He replied, "It's simple. I
set the alarm clock for 5:30. Then I poked my wife and asked, 'Golf
course or intercourse?' And she said, 'Wear your sweater.'"

I am trying to rebuild the recently posted ALSA driver package for my 
kernel.  Although I run Red Hat 7.3, I am not using a Red Hat kernel 
package: my kernel is lovingly downloaded, configured, and built by 
hand.  Call me old fashioned.

Sadly, the RPM rebuild fails part way through:

     % rpm --rebuild alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-fr6.src.rpm

     gcc -DALSA_BUILD -D__KERNEL__ -DMODULE=1 \
     -I/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3/include \
     -I/lib/modules/2.4.18/build/include -O2 \
     -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686 -DLINUX -Wall \
     -Wstrict-prototypes -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB \
     -c sound.c

     sound.c:41: `snd_hack_usb_set_interface' undeclared here (not in a \
     function)

     sound.c:41: initializer element is not constant

     sound.c:41: (near initialization for \
     __ksymtab_snd_hack_usb_set_interface.value')

     make[1]: *** [sound.o] Error 1

The line in question looks like this:

	/* USB workaround */
	#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2, 5, 24)
	#if defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO) || \
	defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO_MODULE) || \
	defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_MIDI) || \
	defined(CONFIG_SND_USB_MIDI_MODULE)
-41-> 
EXPORT_SYMBOL(snd_hack_usb_set_interface);
	#endif
	#endif

Any suggestions?

*Political spam on your cell phone?*
By Lisa M. Bowman <mailto:lisa.bowman@cnet.com>

*In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially 
the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has 
declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose 
who funded them.*

In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such 
messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could 
easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional 
information won't be required.

The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as 
campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the 
same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous 
political spam.

Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had 
asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring 
financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would 
use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.

Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from 
the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was 
supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular 
Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade 
groups.

FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the 
commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the 
potential to reach more voters.

"We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before 
everyone understands how the technology is going to work," he said.

Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or 
allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political 
messages while remaining anonymous.

Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.

Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as 
"good for America."

"It will allow people to receive more communication from those running 
for office," he said. "We have free speech on our side."

Such as?

Anything equivalent will be spam, just not email spam.  Dump entry IPs for
an anonymizing network onto a public bulletin board that's used for other
purposes -- still spam.  Etc etc.

I'm not arguing against other solutions, I'm arguing that spam is speech.  
If you let governments ban it, you're giving them the power to choose who 
gets to speak.

It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you
visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party
officials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the
mail.  

Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.

But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, 
but so what.

XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a
company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,
divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very
gpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to
put preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.

Some notes from other places....

>>From Doom9 [3]
"XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4
Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.
Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers
have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those
who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -
which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it
under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma
codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen
code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only
disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once
again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today
nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public
in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince
Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has
been resolved XviD development will not continue.

That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about
the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.
Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors
first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes
and kept quiet about the matter at hand.

[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of
the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.
However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release
makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we
might be hearing more about this.

[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it
also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD
doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides
with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before
downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd
fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with
Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX
compatible as it was advertised.

[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma
source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The
license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and
install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now
clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)
that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the
copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and
replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you
can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright
statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on
your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken
from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different
copyright notices which is quite funny."

Senders should vary the recipient list to include non-targets, like party
officials, and to exclude targets enough to give them plausible
deniability.

"There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that "criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries." Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.


"Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution," said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.

I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the "schooling" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.

The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:


Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term "financial gain" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.


Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as "financial gain"
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.

The statute of limitations:


507. Limitations on actions

(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.

(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.

The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.

I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned "schooling" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

And yet STILL noone is out there creating _public domain_ content. Is there
even one person out there can can even begin to talk without being a
complete hypocrite? And no the "open source" people cant talk either, the
GPL aint even close. I know I cant talk.

If the creator didnt say you could have it without paying, it's theft, so
simple, hell that's even in all the major holy books.

Fair use needs to be clarified a bit and then I hope they start locking
people up. How else do i ever have hope of finding a job working for someone
that makes things people are supposed to ... *drumroll* pay for.

If I have any RPMS in

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/

that could be useful to some one with a real apt repository or someone who wants to
maintain a package, be it known I am not selfish :)

I found stuff I thought would later get popular so I would not have to maintain the
RPMs for them after they hit the big time. Gnump3d is an exapmple of this.

So if anyone is psyched, go for it. If so, let me know so I can get the RPMs from
you in the future.

Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

When out-of-the-box parsing & transform of XML in java is 25x slower than
C++ on the same hardware then it does matter.

There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With
static object allocation and a few other programming
techniques, performance differences disappear, but
C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.
The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every
embedded platform has C cross-compilers. Many have
C++ compilers. But there is still a range of
platforms that have the first but not the second. Or
at least, that was the story a few years ago.

 May I assume that x86-64 will be able to use a 64bit time_t too?

Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to
be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit
_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter
as much in the embedded world.

And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec
[fibrechannel], every cycle DOES count.

Definately still very very true. C++ compilers are still a rarity.

In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

If your problem just requires application of a "design pattern" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.

Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.

Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code

It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Not.

Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.

Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.


I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.

I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup. 

The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.

So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with
hosting365, and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing
working nice and easily.
At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3
mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly, although it appears that I have
to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
"To:" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.

Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.

Thanks,

	David.

Hi All,
I'm trying to set up the following:

1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for LAN connectivity
2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for
DNS/DHCP etc.

Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.

I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the
default route or something).

Is there standard "out of the box" Linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ?  (I'm planning on non routable
addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0
interface).

Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need
to follow ? 
Thanks,
Dermot.

Hi Dermot, if have a look at one of the dists. like www.smoothwall.org, it
will save you lots of time and effort, and should do eveything you want.

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove
the appropiate zone(s) on your slaves, and refresh your DNS servers.

Bind has a special case, if you set the serial to '0' I think. DNS &
Bind should have something on that.

All things considered, I get that effect with Mailman, but the viable
alternatives are ezmlm, which is loonware and I'm avoiding on principle,
and majordomo, which seems to have stagnated. Oh, and there's apparently
something called SmartList which is a bitch to set up.

Trust me, you do *not* want to running your own mailing lists

You'll wind up crying in a dark room looking for something

Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.

Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem 
to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as 
being less than 2002082601.

That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.

STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUX
by
John Sterne

The launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the
Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, it
seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has already
sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  When
the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will
be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.

ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a
training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.
Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the
Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish
universities.

The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme
that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source
style of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational
channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software
with its operating environment and offering networked support
services to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed
to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to
schools and universities throughout the world.

Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance
features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to
master on personal systems.

The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red
Hat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial
services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now
its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,
although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in
Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.

David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,
sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take
a more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his
office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish
companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced
some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.


-------------
Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.

 Null, the third beta was out last week.

 It'll be an interesting release. Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,
large projects.

 I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...

 Though many say "RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish" - it's worth baring in
mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not
just the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.

If you haven't already, you should enable the debug log under
Hacking Support preferences and look for clues there.

Vernon,

I'm changing the instructions in the SpamAssassin INSTALL file 
right now to:

tar xfvz dcc-dccproc.tar.Z
cd dcc-dccproc-X.X.X
./configure && make && make install
cdcc 'info'


Let me know ASAP if that's innapropriate, since we're shipping 
2.40 today!

Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow - it is fast.  Comes with some lovely client tools
also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single
developer license downloadable from their website.

Here's a weird and wacky problem:

I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.

This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.

Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?

Cheers,
Waider.

 This is a pain. 

 The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do:

 rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*

 RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.

Does using the --oldpackage flag help your pain, or is your pain caused 
by "Obsoletes" flags?

My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered "with all faults", so
at least they are honest).

Is there a way to get my read email downloaded off webmail.eircom.net.

I've been reading the emails using the web based interface. But I've
reached my quota limit. There doesn't seem to be any way to get the
emails off the server. I can connect to the account using POP, but that
only retrieves unread emails. There's also no way to mark emails as
unread from the html interface.

Is there a way I can use fetchmail perhaps to get it to pull down all
the emails and remove them off the server.

It's been years since I've used fetchmail, I don't recall be able to do
this.

Any other suggestions welcome. There's a few hundred email so I don't
fancy going through each one forwarding it to another account.

Glen

Seems fetchmail has a -a switch to get it all.

Just need to install fetchmail now :)

It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports
PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.

The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from America or the UK.

Hope this is useful,
Joe

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that
software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

having great fun trying to find a dumb ADSL modem with Ethernet
presentation, everybody wants to sell routers but I intend on doing pppoe
from another device, something with more than one Ethernet port would be
nice.
anybody got any recommendations ?

I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.

Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
also have a message board.

The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
userfriendly.

All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.

Rebranding: taking something and changing nothing about it except its name. 
In the UK Marathon bars became Snickers bar, Jif cleaning fluid became Cif 
and Talking Stick became Secret Chiefs, y'know?

So, I've been letting the little .exe of SETI@Home run endlessly on my PC .  Last total for this upgrade approx.
420 hours of scanning time.  And still no ET.  I'm so disappointed.
Does anyone else on the list let Berkeley use their computer for research in this manner?

A New Theory on Mapping the New World

By Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07

In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
"America." With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.
Did someone get there earlier?

Man admits Soham kidnapping hoax calls

A man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the
disappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.
Wrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde made
three calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the
youngsters.
He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers
traced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street.
The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one
count of wasting police time on August 15 this year.
The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls
having been drinking all day.
Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor
calculated but added that this was no excuse.
He said: "What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's
caused the families is unacceptable."
Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will
be sentenced.
The hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the
defendant has been warned custody is an option.

> That always amazes me about 'regular' dreams - how often they come true.

In 1993 or so, when I was a student in Edinburgh, I had a bad dream about
being chased around a house by a scary murderous tramp who was carrying a
bag full of half-penny coins (which had long since ceased to be legal
tender). The next morning as I left the flat, I found a half-penny on the
doormat right outside our door. Fair gave me the willies, that did.

Using Razor2 via SpamAssasin.

System is Solaris 2.7, with qmail. Spamassassin run via user's procmail.
All users who use SA have run razor-register.

Razor2 is failing, and I can't find anything in the limited docs or on 
google on it,
and I'm hoping someone can help.

The error (which doesn't prevent SA from working) is:

Oct  2 06:38:22 sancho2 qmail: 1033565902.186041 delivery 4588: success: 
razor2_check_skipped:_Bad_file_number_Can't_locate_object_m
ethod_"new"_via_package_"Razor2::Client::Agent"_(perhaps_you_forgot_to_load_"Razor2::Client::Agent"?)_at_/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_p
erl/5.6.1/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm_line_374./did_0+0+1/

Looking at Dns.pm doesn't really help me, and Razor2::Client::Agent appears 
to be in the right place,
in /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Client.

Ideas?

...Chris

White House: President's "War Boner" Must Be Satisfied

..."The President can't seem to hide his excitement about a possible
military conflict with Iraq. At a recent function honoring America's
war widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to
the subject of the Middle East.

'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other
nations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq's
borders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over
again without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will
seed Iraq with American-style democracy.'

Aides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with
a special cleanser/biocide not used since the Clinton
administration.".....

what takes time and money: noting the amounts of each correction and basing
the refund delivery method on the amount.  yesh, it's silly to spend $.37 (+
labor and materials) for a $.02 refund, but maybe the only alternative right
now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep
the money (see john hall below).  your mailed refund is a function of bulk.

in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service
and over-charging.  what will probably happen: if the amount of overage per
customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the
customer.  If it's less, the combined total amount will go to the city as
lump sum settlement.

in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like
their lump sum to go.  of courese, they'd have to be notified by mail first.

They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an
insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
$.02.

Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
starts adding up.

kelly, same thing as when you used to come to frogstone on Dalnet. 
#frogstone is still there, and also #forteana. If you want to go to 
quakenet, just change your server (in mIRC if that is what you use) 
to that.

my local ISP works great with my iMac. I don't know what you guys

anything else.

Crossing my fingers though....I did a upgrade to Jaguar, and ended up 
doing a scrape and install after that. 

Oh, and I am on 56k dialup

This I would guess is normal, but don't you get it at the very beginning of
the build? Isn't this at the end just a reminder?

Argh, I forgot to exclude aaxine from the %files when using "--without
aalib" :-(
The current "fr6.1" spec file fixes this...

Nope, this is "normal" as Red Hat removed all mp3 support from 8.0 because
of patent and royalty issues :-(
On freshrpms.net, you can find the xmms mp3 plugin as I said, but also
libmad, lame (mp3 encoder), and soon mpg321 as I often used it myself.
Many other players can also play mp3 files, like alsaplayer, xine, mplayer.

> like mplayer not working also and gives black screen

This is not normal though...
Try "mplayer -vo help" then try usinf various output methods to see if some
do work or not.

_Kevin Hemenway_: Finding More Channels[1]. &#8220;In simple terms, there are 
thousands of web sites that are actively providing their news and headlines in 
a format AmphetaDesk can understand [RSS]. And while AmphetaDesk knows about a 
good number of these sites, it'd be impossible to hunt down each and every 
single possibility. So, this page is here to teach you how to fish.&#8221;

Yahoo: The Case for Regime Change[1].



    

    Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of 
    president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the 
    results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities 
    and intimidation.  

    [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major 
    U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led 
    by European forces. "Civilian casualties would likely be substantial," said 
    a French military analyst. "But the American people must be liberated from 
    tyranny." 

    [...] "Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles," 
    said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. "Their 
    single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true 
    parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be 
    retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of 
    the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by 
    the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and 
    poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have 
    a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will 
    require many years."

    



Welcome news. The only way to crush America's fundamentalist tendencies is by 
showing them who's boss.

After discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, Steven 
"Hackers" Levy interviewed lawmen, academics and WiFi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 

    I downloaded my mail and checked media news on the Web. When I confessed 
    this to FBI agent Bill Shore, he spared the handcuffs. "The FBI wouldn't 
    waste resources on that," he sniffed. Now I know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that I broke a law. What's more, I certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. Because—and this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumbling—when you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a God-given right. One day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygen—and arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in "AllowDuplicated", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.

'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually 
quite funny .. if DMA was enabled for the CD-ROM *and* you tried to access 
a CD with Joliet extensions. Otherwise it worked just fine with DMA 
enabled :)

There are complex problems inherent in attempts to implement this.

Check your local friendly Red Hat installation:

[root@localhost up2date]# rpm --checksig zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm
zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm: md5 gpg ok

Of course, this is only as useful as, say, the gpg keys distributed with 
the Kernel tarballs, i.e. if you don't actually bother checking the sig 
then you are open to abuse. It's entirely possible that rpm can be 
configured to require good signatures, but I've not read that part of 
the fine manual just yet.

Cheers,
Waider.

Thanks for the info AJ, I found "weblog" at 
http://awsd.com/scripts/weblog/index.shtml which has some click-path 
reporting. It's simple, but works. Report generation takes a bit though, even 
with dns resolution turned off..

 Fake bank website cons victims
 
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 
 Convincing site 
 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims. 

 A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had "the" in
 front of the bank's name. 
 
 "I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated," said the NCIS
 spokesman. "It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online." 
 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. 

 Domain games 
 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 
 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 
 "To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology," said the spokesman. 
 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 
 Modern gloss 
 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

Lennon killer seeks parole again

The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just "a picture on an album cover" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.

Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop

Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality

Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take "direct action" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: "It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
"The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down," it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an "action plan," including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
"taking steps towards appropriate direct action".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: "Watch this space." Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. "It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation," she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. "Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God."

Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London

James Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
"This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory," said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. "It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy," said Dr Barclay. "It looks like they're here to stay."
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

------- Additional Comments From spamassassin-contrib@msquadrat.de  2002-10-08 04:16 -------
I'm gonna fix this one. I think the best solution will be to copy the modified 
rules to blib and install them from there. Then the rules files will be 
changed on build time and not install time, too.

Nobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work 

Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in
physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in
nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.
Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,
D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering
contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic
X-ray sources.''
Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other
half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the
University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant
underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from
the sun by the billion.
Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because
they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.
In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South
Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino
detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and
also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of
the brightest objects in the universe.
The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for
building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and
sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.
His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the
discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the
hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.
When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside
Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba
also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach
Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.
This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney
Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,
55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the
Karolinska Institute.
The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ
growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how
viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as
AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday
morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel later the same day.
The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish
Academy said on Tuesday.
The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -
will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.
The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are
not publicly revealed for 50 years.
Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.
In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to
those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and
``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field
of physics.''
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and
economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts
in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted
in strict secrecy.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in
1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

Lioness adopts fifth antelope

Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means "the blessed one" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari ("taken by
force"), was adopted at the weekend.
"She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony," said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved.

Ananova:  
Dracula theme park could be switched to Bucharest

A controversial scheme to build a Dracula theme park in Romania could be
switched away from Transylvania.
Consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers is now recommending that it be built in
Bucharest instead.
It comes after Prince Charles led international protests against the
original proposals to build it in the medieval town of Sigishoara.
PricewaterhouseCoopers name Bucharest, originally believed to be an outsider
in the race to host the park, as the most profitable location for the
project.
But that has angered residents in Sigishoara, where Vlad the Impaler, the
inspiration for Dracula, was born. They are counting on the park to boost
the local economy.
Evenimentul Zilei reports that Sigishoara was placed behind the capital with
the Black Sea port of Constanta third choice.
Dorin Danesan, mayor of Sigishoara, said: "The pre-feasibility report from
PWC shows that the park would attract more tourists if it was located in
Bucharest. But I still think that Sigishoara is the best location for it."
The park would include hotels, a Dracula roller coaster, catacombs, a ghost
train and a house of horrors, as well as vampire dungeons located around a
reconstruction of Dracula's castle and an artificial lake.
The project has also been objected to by the world heritage organisation
Unesco fearing Sigishoara might be spoilt.
PricewaterhouseCoopers is to present its final report on the project on
October 15.

Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption

Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words "let's have sex".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as "let's have intercourse" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean "you will see for yourselves" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants "should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
intercourse.
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

HUBBLE SPOTS AN ICY WORLD FAR BEYOND PLUTO
------------------------------------------
Astronomers have discovered a distant body that appears to be the
largest object in the Kuiper Belt, a body half the size of Pluto that
raises new questions about the definition of a planet. The icy world
2002 LM60 has been dubbed "Quaoar".

ASTRONOMERS SLICE AND DICE GALAXIES
-----------------------------------
New views of star birth and the heart of a spiral galaxy have been
seen by a state-of-the-art astronomical instrument on its first
night. The new spectrometer has a revolutionary ability to 'slice'
any object in the sky into sections, producing a three dimensional
view of the conditions throughout entire galaxies in a single
observation.

I think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database
is key to decentralization. 

Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.
Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency
  by have some play with time and value
Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's
  called congnitive dissonance theory
Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale
  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.

I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.
decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround
from technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way
inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by 
protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. 
The local information when combined with the technical
troubles of providing "just enough" forced synchronization
to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.
enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when
concerns are more immedidate.  

Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how
people cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily
pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck
who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the
whole world would be a little more perfect and everything,
including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently
be in its proper place.

BUSH COVERS THE WATERFRONT
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It may seem like all Iraq, all the time in the Oval Office, but
the president has at least one other thing on his mind this
week: that pesky port lockout. The freight still isn't moving,
factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and
retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing
day. 

On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to 
see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this 
isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one 
day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the
next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the
1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work
for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the
disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax dosages.

Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or
safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao
covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work
stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew 
Iraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quickly
responded that their members have been unloading military cargo
throughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but an
anonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion 
of what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."

Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley
would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the
other hand, "Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the
increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in
polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political
danger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco 
Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll
reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the 
economy. "Though the administration promised an unbiased
examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his
mind that it was hurting national security and the economy,
andmerited federal intervention," said the AP. 

As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor
disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers
simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case).
One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers'
contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78
days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer

THE BIGGEST CABLE HOOKUP
-----------------------------------------------------------------
wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry "fowl." 
We mean "foul." The two dominant direct broadcast satellite
players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big
Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice
Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of
DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite 
service in the US.

The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed
merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- 
it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and
$25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as 
some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents,
and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV
and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?

The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold
off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice
Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified
"major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss with
Justice in the next weeks.

The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those
revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies
to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted 
to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the 
cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.

TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for
investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for
expanded-service television may be nearing saturation.
TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded,
"Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but
shareholders may realize much smaller returns."

The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch 
waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for
DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the
current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson

					<P>It may seem like all Iraq, all the time in the Oval Office, but the president has at least one other thing on his mind this week: that pesky port lockout. The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day. </P><P>
On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax
dosages.</P><P>
Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). "Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown," said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official "said that only a portion of
what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore."</P><P>
Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, "Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration," said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the
economy. "Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention," said the AP. </P><P>
As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>wo birds want to join forces and the FCC is about to cry "fowl." We mean "foul." The two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with Big Cable. Federal regulators, both the FCC and the Justice Department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of DirecTV with Dish Network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the US.</P><P>
The press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between EchoStar Communications and Hughes Electronics -- it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. It was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. Hughes is DirecTV and EchoStar is Dish. All straight?</P><P>
The two companies sent a letter to the FCC urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the Justice Department has spoken. EchoStar and Hughes offered unspecified "major revisions" to the deal that they want to discuss with Justice in the next weeks.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take -- specifically, selling some frequencies to Cablevision. The Journal reported that Cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project.</P><P>
TheStreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. It seems the market for expanded-service television may be nearing saturation. TheStreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, "Consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns."</P><P>
The New York Times and the Journal both mentioned Rupert Murdoch waiting in the wings. Last year Murdoch's News Corp. bid for DirecTV, but lost out at the last minute to EchoStar. If the current deal falls through, he'll be back. - Keith Dawson</P><P>

 I seem to be having a little trouble with it. My printers.conf is:

<DefaultPrinter lp>
Info Hp4050
Location locals
DeviceURI ipp://192.168.2.90:9100/
State Idle
Accepting Yes
JobSheets none none
QuotaPeriod 0
PageLimit 0
KLimit 0
</Printer>

 and cupds uses that to make a printcap of:

lp:

 Sounds dodgy to me. If someone has an example printers.conf/printcap for
a JetDirect printer, I'd appreciate it if they sent it on.

The forums there are very informative, and there is also more info on
using linux on the mini ITX boards at http://linitx.org/.

A couple of the autopc projects make interesting reading in this regard:
http://thisstrife.com/ but most of them seem to use windows for some
unknown reason.....

When posting to this list excerpts from books I've just read, I usually
refrain from adding any comments, letting the listmembers interpret them
as they see fit.

But since you asked....

I chose to post this text simply because I thought it was a particularly
risible example of Doyle's invincible faith and his refusal to accept the

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.

I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

I'd just like to recommend the newest Viz to ukers just for the hilarious "David 
Blaine: Stalag Magician".  The ego'd one is in a WWII prison camp and sort of 
trying to escape.  Several times he seems to have escaped and the british 
officers celebrate before it's revealed he's been buried alive or hiding in a 
freezer.  At one point he's asked why and says "Well it's not for publicity" 
Cracking stuff.

Someone should shout "Godwin!" at him at a press conference.  Then he'd have to 
shut up.  Or does that only work on Usenet?

This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon
products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as
a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -
there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,
but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created 
much more easily within the petrochemical industry.

Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower
oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world 
war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from
waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. 

Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as 
petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication 
of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously
being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately 
matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock
oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the
gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to 
cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.

My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.
Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals
(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely 
difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the
petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect
that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,
just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,
for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.

All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling
like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure

Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating," Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe

John Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.

The Electronic Telegraph

 Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 "The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet," said Kommersant.
 
 "In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 "the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 "The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks."
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 "For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle."
 
 One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country "where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that "thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 "Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens."
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

 Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him

Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as "Captain Hook", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not "representative" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more "representative" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

Pro-hunt activists target top sight

ONE of Yorkshire's most famous sights yesterday became one of the first
targets in bizarre attacks on White Horse landmarks linked to the hunting
debate.
Villagers near Thirsk could not believe their eyes when they woke yesterday
to find the famous White Horse of Kilburn had acquired a rider during the
night.
In another incident, the Uffington white horse in Oxfordshire had a huntsman
and three hounds added to the ancient figure, which is thought to represent
a Celtic god or tribal symbol.
Pro-hunt activists in the Real Countryside Alliance (RCA) ­ a radical
alternative to the better-known Countryside Alliance ­ admitted
responsibility last night for targeting the two images.
The 314ft by 228ft landmark at Kilburn has been lovingly preserved since it
was carved in the limestone by schoolmaster John Hodgson and his pupils in
1857.
But during Monday night someone nailed on a massive figure of a huntsman
with a horn ­ which had been cut to scale out of a single piece of white
carpet. It was removed yesterday by members of Kilburn White Horse
Association, who found a Countryside Alliance badge attached to the carpet.
John Roberts of the association said: "It has obviously been very well
organised. It was a well crafted piece of kit: a figure of a huntsman with a
horn cut out of carpets.
"It was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. They tied it
to bushes at the top and nailed it down. It caused all the stone chippings
to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. It will
not get another refit for another year.
"Whoever did it must have come with a vehicle ­ a tractor and trailer or a
lorry ­ because the carpet must have come in one piece. It was extremely
well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off."
The sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south
of England, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs
whitening.
Mr Roberts added: "The damage as such is not great but it adds to the
deterioration, which means it will need more work next time.
"We would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to
take it away again because it was a major job."
Andy Wilson, chief executive of the North York Moors National Park, said:
"It is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud
of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. There is also careful
consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of
vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. There
has not been a cut in the turf ­ which would be much more of a problem. It
would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand."
An RCA spokesman said: "Some people in the country are getting very
frustrated at the inaction. All we want is Ministers to take notice. Marches
don't seem to be doing anything good."
The Countryside Alliance said it did not have any part in the action.
Spokesman Adrian Yelland said: "The Countryside Alliance only ever advocates
campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and
regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident."
The incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in
Yorkshire thought to be RCA work.

Your vote on Crop Idol 
By OLIVER HARVEY

WELCOME to Crop Idol – your chance to choose Britain's most out-of-this-wor=
ld corn circle. 


The intricate patterns, which some say are the work of aliens, are big news=
 again thanks to the spooky new Mel Gibson film Signs.


Nine of the best are shown on the right. You can vote for your favourite by=
 clicking on the image and dialling the number shown beneath.

Calls cost only 10p, or 12 cents from the Republic of Ireland (though it ma=
y be a bit more if you contact us from other planets).

Lines close at 6pm today. We will reveal the
winner tomorrow.


Aliens ... or hoaxers?
THE debate continues to rage over the origin of crop circles.

Many believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers — while others are c=
onvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.

Crop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly a=
nd on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. =


Witnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields =
on the nights that circles appear.

Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a=
ncient religions, mathematics and even music. 

Crop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appea=
r throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the sout=
h of England.

Theories about their cause include whirlwinds — known to circle experts as =
plasma vortexes — earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the huma=
n mind.

In the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs=
, helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.

Raymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last nigh=
t: "It's a great unsolved mystery.

"We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for s=
ure what is making them."

 It's August, and big cats are on the prowl
 By Alan Hamilton
 
 
 
 ROUND up the sheep. Pull on the gauntlets. Oil the shotgun. The British
 countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,
 vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,
 including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair
 samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its
 undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. 
 
 Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,
 founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has
 received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. 
 
 “During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat
 activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from
 the public has been fantastic,” Mr Bamping said. “Big cats in Britain are
 real. They are out there, they are breeding; there’s more of them.” 
 
 Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark
 Fraser, who heads the society’s Scottish arm, said: “Lynx are now present in
 the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I don’t
 want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several
 hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.” 
 
 Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which
 includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as
 well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in
 Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand
 was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black
 hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. 
 
 The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of
 trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the
 beasts, which it will then present to the Government. 
 
 It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.
 Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. 
 
 Next in August: record abductions by aliens.

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause

Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, "to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers".

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.



Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, "to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers".



Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.

In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.

But no-one reported anything to the police.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen "a red blob" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.

In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.

Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

Can someone please tell me what a "pitch" constitutes? I have an idea 
it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim, but this sounds 
more formal.
------------------
Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
sculptures.
Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.

 The sad news is that there seems to be a lot of patents (pending or not)
that's for very basic/general ideas; it's the current form of "domainnapping",
and it might turn uggly when people start trying to enfoce these patents.

I don't endorse the whole RIAA thing, but to be accurate, you would
have to duplicate the chair so that both you and your neighbour could
continue to sit down, and yes, I suppose that would be more serious.

They can sit on /your/ copy, but if you start churning out exact dups
of a name-brand artifact, people with law degrees start to smell
money.  For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as
(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the
patented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar
on eBay with "Gibson" written in crayon on the headstock, and then
claim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get
upset.

    M> Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away
    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  

To play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away,
it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution
rights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn't
stop you from making 10000 copies to sell.

    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  

This is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?
The "other stuff" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.
This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder
to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents
people from doing it?

Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with
sales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit
should be able to "own" someone else's intellectual property.  Sarah
McLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's
the label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest
dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up
tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been
blazingly stupid with her money)

But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so
they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.
If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems
with beautiful-people deadbeat leech "friends" draining their riches,
think again.

The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we
make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,
all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different
way.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.

Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did
the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving
milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/
labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  All
Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or
collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as
something of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal
statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into
their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.

Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay
before they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties
for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for
a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over
again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/
favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriously
warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your
thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It's
the people who make them; the songs are already theirs.

>>>From my 25+ years in the playing field, IMHO the art of job-hunting
(for those not yet de-jobbed) is the art of getting past the HR-stage
interview and into the engineer-to-engineer interview.  HR is not
being honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you
in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have "something
roughly equivalent" (ie "it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.

If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can
usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview.  Most
often, their choice is based 90% on "who can I work with" and only
maybe 10% on "how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?"

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. 
"The XA35 is the first of a family."

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly 
said. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today."

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=========================================================================

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.

"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications," said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. "By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls."

"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security," said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. "DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date."

"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services," said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. "DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications."

And further, why focus on the fact they were laid off and not on the
fact they were hired in the first place?

BTW: I saw someone claim that aside from the efficiency of the market
there were also gains to society from irrational behavior.

If a society has business people that systematically overestimate their
chances, that is bad for the businessmen but on net a big gain for
society.  On the social level, the law of averages works to societies
benefit in a manner it can't for an individual.

A key reason, in this view, that the US wound up outperforming England
was that the English investors were too rational for their societies own
good.

(Except, of course, when US investors were bilking them to build canals
and railroads over here.  Thanks, guys.)

=====================

Applied to telecom: a lot of dark wire (glass) and innovation will
eventually be used for pennies on the dollar, the benefits to society
and the costs to the investors.

If it's not stateful, it wouldn't seem to be worth the effort, although I guess it might help with DDoS attacks.

Sounds snake-oilish to me, but I'm biased by lots of experience with firewalls and proxy servers, and the limitations thereof.

Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.

Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device.

Hardware acceleration for SSL makes sense since PKI can slow down a
transaction by as much as 1,000-fold. Per this article, XML formatting only
increases doc size by about 20-fold.. I'm not sure there are enough "powers
of ten" in there to justify hardware acceleration. 

Expect the next major release from DataPower to be the revolutionary new
"email chip" - allows you to offload the sending and receiving of email
messages onto dedicated hardware while you get on w/ more important things
.. like listening to MP3s..

Best, 
Paul Sholtz

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a

family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The

DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure," Kelly said. 
"The XA35 is the first of a family."

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up

to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

"Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only," Kelly 
said. "A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today."

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company

itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code," said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,

while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes

and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of

XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application

co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in

May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of

products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,

drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer

in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and

sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.

Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions

at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.

"Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications," said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

"DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web

services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance." A single

DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

"In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises," said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. "By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls."

"We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly

growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security," said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. "DataPower is on

their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date."

"XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services," said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. "DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely

on XML for mission critical applications."

Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used
on all transaction in order to process them... So this has some preaty heavy
implications, unless it's just BS.

Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

Again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...

Barbara Babbles;
Be amazed - I've never bought anything online since an almighty cock up
with amazon dot con (that's not a typo) a few years back where I lost
all the dosh I'd paid them and had no books to show for it either. Had
it been the UK branch I'd have had them in the small claims court
quicker than you could drop LOTR on your foot and say "ouch", but as it
was the US branch I'd just no comeback.

Hey,
I has just been given an old Toshiba CS100 with earliest pentium and 400mb
of HD but only a floppy drive on it, its got Win3.1 which is funny to see
again but gonna be cleared as soon as i stop messing with it. What I was
wondering was could anyone advise what O/S would be good for this, I want a
small usable *nix distro for it that i can transfer to it fom floppy.
Connecting this to Winblows>i know that winblows allows pier-to-pier
connections over serial and parellel ports to other winblows but is this
easy do for connecting winblows to *nix???

Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and
did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).

However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby:

http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html

whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea.  You
could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and
mount the fat32 partition.

Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the
maptop far more useful in the long run.

$ find /dir -name \*  | xargs du -s | sort -n

Smallest files are listed first with the largest at the end. So if
you want to get the 5 largest files, pipe through tail.

e.g.

$ find /dir -name \*  | xargs du -s | sort -n | tail -5

You might want to put a '-type f' on that find.

no idea.

the above was something along the lines i was attempting, once i 
realised it was a straight swap. but i couldnt get awk's gensub to 
insert the \x for %'s and ='s.

anyway, in the end i found something on the internet and adapted it:

function decode_url (str,    hextab,i,c,c1,c2,len,code) {

        # hex to dec lookup table
        hextab ["0"] = 0;       hextab ["8"] = 8;
        hextab ["1"] = 1;       hextab ["9"] = 9;
        hextab ["2"] = 2;       hextab ["A"] = 10;
        hextab ["3"] = 3;       hextab ["B"] = 11;
        hextab ["4"] = 4;       hextab ["C"] = 12;
        hextab ["5"] = 5;       hextab ["D"] = 13;
        hextab ["6"] = 6;       hextab ["E"] = 14;
        hextab ["7"] = 7;       hextab ["F"] = 15;

        decoded = "";
        i   = 1;
        len = length (str);
        while ( i <= len ) {
                c = substr (str, i, 1);
                # check for usual start of URI hex encoding chars
                if ( c == "%" || c == "=" ) {
                        if ( i+2 <= len ) {
                                # valid hex encoding?
                                c1 = toupper(substr(str, i+1, 1));
                                c2 = toupper(substr(str, i+2, 1));
                                if ( !(hextab [c1] == "" && hextab [c2] == "") ) {
                                        code = 0 + hextab [c1] * 16 + hextab [c2] + 0
                                        c = sprintf ("%c", code)
                                        i = i + 2
                                }
                        }
                # + is space apparently
                } else if ( c == "+" ) {
                        c = " "
                }
                decoded = decoded c;
                ++i;
        }

Hi,

I've got an normal 3.5" CD-RW IDE drive that I'd like to be able to use with a
Dell Latitude CPx laptop that I've got. Does anyone know any way to enable this,
for example through the use of a special cable for the Modular Bay (where CD-ROM
or floppy drive is normally).

There is also the possibility of using a docking station, but Dell's docking
solution for the Latitude series doesn't seem to allow for the use of an IDE
drive, only SCSI... Unless someone knows of a "non-Dell" solution that's
compatible.

Anyone any ideas?

Thanks,

Darren.

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5" drive with a
laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5" drive
will work in that case.

Example :

Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head
only reads the first n lines.

Cheers,
Dave.

 Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5" to 3.5" IDE cable,
and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the
IDE cable too.

 Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.

Ok, Iknow this is blatantly OT but I'm beginning to go insane.
Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
what the problem might be give me a shout.

Cheers,
Peter.

Go on. Tell them how long the /first/ one lasted.

I vote external firewire if the laptop has the ports for it.

I vote usb 1.1 as the chances are the cdr drive is not over 8x write and
thus fireware is of no real use...
but i cant see how you are going to get it working without a cradle. I cant
even get my dell laptop dvd drive to work
as the connectors are not the same as my cd drive ones.. seems dell cant
keep any standards going :-(

Here is what you do.

Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.

Turn on the system.
If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.

Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
lack of video card then.

Switch it off.
Remove it's ram.

Same procedure as above.

If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
up your system without a heatsink & fan).

If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.

Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.
Power On Self Test.

Ie if you are getting a little orange LED when you plug it in then your PSU
is probably working.

Just for the record mc has a nice directory
comparison function. This is really nice
when using the ftp VFS for e.g. Of course
if you use something like ftpfs you can use
the previously mentioned tools.

Hello folks!
I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
for it.
Minicom is very much able to dial out.
But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
somewhere).
It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.

Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

Thanks a million.
Carlos

Perl's pack() would do the job...

Actually, it was worse - a bodycheck showed up a "remove" URL. I
need a new spam filter (but I want to be able to process false
positives, rather than dump them).

I think everybody has their own version of this,
but in case it's useful.. (only tested on Linux):

find $* \( -type f -o -type l \) -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -print0 |
xargs -r0 du -b --max-depth 0 |
sort -k1n |
grep -v "^0"

Pádraig.

find / -xdev -type f -exec du -sk {} \; | sort -rn | head -5

        -xdev will stop find recursing into other filesystems.

I'm not familiar with Dell Dimension XPS, and, to be honest, not familiar
with any brand-name computers. Most of my experience is China
motherboards, but I've seen same behavior once. Changing the battery helps
that time. It was big round battery with 'Panasonic' on it.
Computer starts beeping then we removed battery from MB. It even booted up
(well, loosing time and some other things).

Just my 2 cents.

And I've been told by a SuSE rep that 8.1 will be out in October,

Hi all,

I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)

I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)

Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the "alsa-driver" source rpm for your running kernel
  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this "alsa-driver" package
- Install the "alsa-libs" package
- Install the "alsa-utils" package

Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)

Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) "by hand" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! ("dmesg" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.

With "aplay" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!

It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the "alsa-driver" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).

I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

Download :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

Current spec files :
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )

Matthias

PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run "xine -A alsa09" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

I've an XMMS Alsa module I've been using for a while now at:
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.i686.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630.spec

Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too:
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i386.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i686.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71.spec

Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of
the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I
can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.

As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging
for many releases now.

I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these
rpms do not work on (null).

That's "angle" as in geometry.

FWIW, I would now recommend doing this (using a user with a procmailrc)
instead of a system alias; more secure, and easier to filter out crud
like bounces, virii etc. that render a corpus dirty.

While I was playing with the past issues, it annoyed me that there was
no easy way to make the log stop growing (I don't mean to truncate it,
I mean to just freeze it for a while).

The following patch adds a new button to the log window, which allows
the log to be switched on/off (the button says "Disable" when the
log is enabled, and the button disables it, and "Enable" when the log
is frozen, and the button enables it again).

http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html

LIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. 

Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. 

Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. 

At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as "Little Chicago." 

Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. 

But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. 

"The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care," Jose Sandoval, author of "Mother Aged 5," told Reuters. 

"We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective," he added. 

'Totally willing to help'
Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. 

"We're totally willing to help her," said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. 

Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. "She got no help (in 1939) that I know about," he said. "She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true." 

Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. 

Medical rarity
No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. 

One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. 

He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. 

Her swelling stomach worried her parents. "They thought it was a tumor," he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. 

There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. 

Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. 

Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. 

More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. 

One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. 

But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in "moral danger," and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. 

But Sandoval said: "It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them." 

Happy ending?
Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. 

Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. 

After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. 

He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. 

Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. 

She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. "We just want to get on with our lives, that's it," said Jurado, adding he thought "absolutely nothing" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. 

He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. 

He said its value was "more or less $25,000" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. 

"If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property," he said. 

As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. "I believe there will be a happy ending," he said. 

"As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the Republic is destroyed."
Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col. William F Elkins)

Politicians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool 
for fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole 
'anonymity' thing. Also I notice this story shows the truth - the 
Canadian government is really located in Washington, DC, Ottawa is just 
a branch office. Come to think of it, the last story I posted about 
Canada featured the head of its military, 'speaking to us from military 
HQ  in Palm Beach, Florida.'

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com>
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr>

*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*

A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> 
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.

The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
<http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada 
<http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.

Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the 
process of considering.

If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find "hidden 
electronic and digital devices" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.

Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, 
or ratified, the treaty.

Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.

"It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes," Geist said. "To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case."

Geist added that "there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems."

Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.

"It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies," according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.

Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. "Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers," Andrews said. "The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data." EPIC opposes 
<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.

Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends "the establishment of a national database" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. "The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information," 
the draft says.

Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database "a dumb idea."

"Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously," Hosein said.

A representative for George Radwanski 
<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not "have any comments on 
the paper as it stands."

Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca 
<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.

Pictish pictograms (still undeciphered)

I'd be interested in an update on the latest thinking on these things.
Particularly the 'swimming elephant' pictogram.

There's a book come out recently on the world's undeciphered scripts
(including Linear A and Etruscan).
Has any list member read it?

2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort

Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: "Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long."
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
on 08705 555 999.

Close encounter of burnt kind

IT came from outer space ­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation ­ that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed ­ because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
"I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface," she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
auction.
She added: "If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite."
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
"Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock," he said.
"They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
"Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear."
To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
"Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
"However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,"
he added.

 'Lost' penguins found alive
 
 by Charles Miranda

 A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a "big huddle". 

 The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: "The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter." 
 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

Hi,

some time now the following messages were haunting me:

     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude

It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.

# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches
...

I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is "dude", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Regards, Axel.

Subject: [zzzzteana] Big cats 'on the increase'
Reply-To: zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm


Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record
numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. 
The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of
animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers
over the past 12 months. 

And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the
average moggy, it claims to have "firm evidence" that the majority are real.


Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the
critics and doubters, adding: "I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same
realm as the Loch Ness monster. 

"But it's not, they are really out there." 

'Cats with cubs' 

Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the
country. 

Big cat reports  
Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire 
January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx 
November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat 
April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 
1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  
"This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,
Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire," he said. 

The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. 

But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in
sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. 

"We have had sightings of cats with cubs," he added. 

'Trigger camera' 

The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including
photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. 

But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public
that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. 

A national "trigger camera" project is planned which, the society hopes,
will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. 

Mr Bamping said: "The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and
take a picture of itself." 

'Like dogs' 

The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the
wild, or their descendants. 

Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: "In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big
cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. 

"But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people
released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them
down, or take them to a zoo."

Subject: [zzzzteana] US Army tests portable translator
Reply-To: zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stm

US soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

"This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,"
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. 

The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. 

Speaking in tongues 

"In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody," Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. 

 
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
 
"In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. 

"You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them," he said. 

The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. 

The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

"The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support," explained Mr Frederking. 

Slow system 

For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. 

The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. 

"It went reasonably well half the time," said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. 

The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. 

But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. 

The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

Ananova:  
Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'

Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
bees.
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: "In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection."
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

Subject: [zzzzteana] Betamax finally laid to rest
Reply-To: zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm


Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. 

They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 

 
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. 

Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. 

Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 

"With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts," Sony said in a statement. 

Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. 

The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. 

But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. 

In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 

Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 

The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 

A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 

Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

For goddess' sake Martin that seems to be exactly what you're doing.  You 
started your reply to Tim's posting of the Guardian article by suggesting that 
it was factually inaccurate.  Did you actually read it or did you just assume 
that if the Grauniad writes about a Muslim extremist they must be making him out 
as an all round nice guy?

Zimbabwe eases GM stance

Zimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grain
so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency.
The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said
Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in
the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.
Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute
ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.
But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of
checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system.
There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative
export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are
GM-free.
Aid
Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
"The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in
accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other
countries in the region," Mr Morris told journalists.
"It will enable us to do our job," he said.
Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern
Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the
region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.
The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes
of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.
The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's
campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has
worsened the situation, say many donors.
Lost markets
The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.
Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling
it as 'poison' .
Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be
planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.
United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that
Americans eat GM maize every day.
The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption
and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.

Subject: [zzzzteana] Frog Fall at Cheapside
Reply-To: zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
"like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London."

Was "like a frog in Cheapside" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?

And to what event or events does it refer?

I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch
Phrases.*

Getting your own domain needn't be expensive, looks more professional, and
you're not going to suddenly lose your site with little or no notice (yes,
I'm still smarting from bastard Geocities). I registered mine through
http://www.easyspace.com/ - works out about a pound a week for registration
and 30Mb hosting. It's a valuable service, there's no reason not to expect
to pay.

 Scissors are a snip for Third World
 From Richard Owen in Rome
 
 
 
 IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the
 millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from
 passengers’ hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized
 as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain
 is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World
 hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail
 files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for
 them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the
 X-ray scanners. 
 
 Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that
 scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin
 America. 
 
 He told Corriere della Sera that he had “plucked up the courage” to ask the
 authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a
 retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure
 sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. 
 
 Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique,
 Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. “In such countries, what we think of as a
 personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool.” 
 
 The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports.

Yes, confirming what I said in my last message. Ah! I see where the problem 
lies! You seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that Zimbabwe and 
Zambia are the same country.
