<HTML><FONT PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" LANG="0">Dear Friend,<BR>
<BR>
This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
Minnesota. &nbsp;The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. &nbsp;We had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. &nbsp;The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards.<BR>
<BR>
In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not 
find myself in the picture. &nbsp;I looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. &nbsp;To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! &nbsp;Dear God it was me!!! 
&nbsp;My body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should 
a heavy wind arise... it was </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#ffffff"

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0">! &nbsp;I had mirrors in my house but most of them were 
designed to only reflect &nbsp;from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. &nbsp;I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, &nbsp;but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.<BR>
<BR>
Well, this situation was </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000" BACK="#ffffff"

style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="SANSSERIF" 
FACE="Arial" LANG="0"> acceptable. &nbsp;But I was at a loss as to what to do. 
&nbsp;My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. &nbsp;Plus, I hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall 
off the food wagon. &nbsp;My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.<BR>

FACE="Arial" LANG="0">. &nbsp;It seemed to contain everything I needed. &nbsp;
It curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest speed 
possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a 
lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, &nbsp;</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#ff0000"

I figured that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much in remuneration. &nbsp;It is 
guaranteed, but I'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles 
so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.<BR>
<BR>
It's been about 6 weeks now but I swear I'm beginning to look like that

China's rapid economic growth, as ranked by the World Institution, is TEN TIMES 
FASTER than the world economy. 

The only thing US investors should be asking themselves is, "How can I 
participate in this explosion?" We have the answer. Texas-based 
CommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock 
China's amazing potential.

INVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITY

Texas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) 
announces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to 
China in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers of
high pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributor
of its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:
they captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and
you can benefit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW 
may make company history.

Opening China's Door

Using hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, 
CMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of 
entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to 
do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for 
example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say "goodbye" to 
the layers of middlemen.

CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler 

CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This
is an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest
fortunes, from the wonderful age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential
is being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.

CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... 
sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed securities...dynamics of 
a growth company. 

*** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** 

Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US 
companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. 
But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth 
potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start 
of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. 

There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico.

Your Attention, Please

PLEASE REPLY ONLY TO:

(2)  abacha10@mail2africa.com  
(3)  alhajiabubakar10@email.com
 

I  have very confidential and urgent business to
transact with you. But first permit me to say that I
do not know you; you are receiving this mail via blind
carbon copy of email addresses which I obtained from a
simple internet search. You are therefore NOT obliged
to reply. However, if you do, and the conditions are
right, you will be amply compensated. It is also
pertinent to add that I am using an assumed name, and
one the house web based email addresses for my personal
protection .
 
In order to give you a background of this "business
transaction", please appraise the website  

http://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT3PQPP45QC

Before proceeding further, please permit me to give
you more background on the Abacha family "MILLIONS" as
it is now known; please look at the following websites
 
http://www.oneworld.org/ips2/aug98/17_29_059.html

http://www.odiousdebts.org/odiousdebts/index.cfm?DSP=content&ContentID=974

I have taken some pains to give you readings on the
Abacha Family fortunes; They are of  course a matter
of public record, and CONCLUSIVELY PROVES INDEED THAT
GENERAL SANI ABACHA TRANSFERRED BILLIONS OF NOTES
OUT OF NIGERIA ! However, it is conceivable and even
logical that NOT ALL OF THE FORTUNE HAS BEEN
"DISCOVERED" OR FROZEN BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS IN
SYMPATHY AND ON THE REQUEST OF THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT
OF NIGERIA. AND THIS IS A FACT!

The truth of the matter is that much more of the
Abacha fortunes are still hidden , their location a
closely guarded secret; Her Excellency, Hajia
Abacha,widow of Gen. Sani Abacha, ex-head of
State of Nigeria, who died June 8, 1998
and her immediate family are under house arrest in
Nigeria. It is therefore my job to search out a
reliable person, a complete stranger to help
transfer/secure a negotiated amount from the still
hidden millions of notes.  The right person must
pass a background appraisal in order to avoid my being
betrayed to the AUTHORITIES, as happened in the past.
It is now obvious why I will be using an assumed name
for the moment. All precautions will be taken to avoid
leakages. Though I am using the internet which is
largely unsafe, as soon as I get a "reliable"
candidate, I will introduce security measures for
every body's protection. For the moment I am simply a
"Contact Person" for the REAL Abacha family.

In sum, the person I am looking for is an individual
or corporate body that is able to provide one or more
Institution Ledgers into which arrangements will be made to
transfer US$5,000,000.00 to US$10,000,000.00 every
week; The routine, periodic transfers in small
instalments are designed to avoid raising suspicion in
the wrong quarters. These transfers will be secure and
properly legal, and with all proper institution
documentation. The right person may need to establish 
fresh/new RECEIVING INSTITUTION ledgers no charge from legal or
financial encumbrances. Persons with bad advance capability rating
, undischarged asset allowances, companies in receivership
and minors need not reply; Because of the stature and
confidentiality of this proposed transaction, a
successful candidate will receive 25% of all
transfers. Other Conditions, including maximum secrecy
and confidentiality  apply. 

If you are interested in helping this family, and if
you can meet our strict conditions, please reply to
all email addresses listed below. In your reply please
include your phone, fax and contact address. In the
event you do not meet our conditions after a brief
back ground appraisal, you will be communicated
accordingly. Please before replying,  take your time
to go through all the links and investigate thoroughly
all the foregoing; this is a serious proposal, despite
the medium in which you are receiving my message.

Looking forward to your reply,

Yours Sincerely,

Alhaji Abubakar

hidden millions of Notes.  The right person must<br />
pass a background appraisal in order to avoid my being<br />
betrayed to the AUTHORITIES, as happened in the past.<br />
It is now obvious why I will be using an assumed name<br />
for the moment. All precautions will be taken to avoid<br />
leakages. Though I am using the internet which is<br />
largely unsafe, as soon as I get a "reliable"<br />
candidate, I will introduce security measures for<br />
every body's protection. For the moment I am simply a<br />
"Contact Person" for the REAL Abacha family.<br />
<br />
In sum, the person I am looking for is an individual<br />
or corporate body that is able to provide one or more<br />
Institutional Ledgers into which arrangements will be made to<br />
transfer US$5,000,000.00 to US$10,000,000.00 every<br />
week; The routine, periodic transfers in small<br />
instalments are designed to avoid raising suspicion in<br />
the wrong quarters. These transfers will be secure and<br />
properly legal, and with all proper institution<br />
documentation. The right person may need to establish <br />
fresh/new RECEIVING INSTITUTION ledgers unimpeded by legal or<br />
financial encumbrances. Persons with bad advance capability rating<br />
, undischarged asset overages, companies in receivership<br />
and minors need not reply; Because of the stature and<br />
confidentiality of this proposed transaction, a<br />
successful candidate will receive 25% of all<br />
transfers. Other Conditions, including maximum secrecy<br />
and confidentiality  apply. <br />
<br />
If you are interested in helping this family, and if<br />
you can meet our strict conditions, please reply to<br />
all email addresses listed below. In your reply please<br />
include your phone, fax and contact address. In the<br />
event you do not meet our conditions after a brief<br />
back ground appraisal, you will be communicated<br />
accordingly. Please before replying,  take your time<br />
to go through all the links and investigate thoroughly<br />
all the foregoing; this is a serious proposal, despite<br />
the medium in which you are receiving my message.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your reply,<br />
<br />
Yours Sincerely,<br />
<br />

How? Through a business Merchant Ledger!

<p>How the Snore Eliminator will help you!</p>
<b>
<p>What Causes Snoring?</p>
</b></font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">
<p>Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle</p>
<p>Excessive fat on the throat</p>
<p>Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and</p>
<p>Throat swelling from allergies and food</p>
<p>Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the </font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">stopping
of breathing, </font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a <b>blocked airway during sleep.</p>
</b>
<p>The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a <b>weakened current of incoming air. </b>This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.</p>
<p>Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who <b>sleep on their
backs</b>; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
<p>The hidden dangers of snoring?</p>
</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
  </font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">
<p>Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated</p>
<p>Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring</p>
<p>Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical condition</p>

</font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
<p>Snoring decreases sexual performance</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.</p>
<p>Most people who snore have a </font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">shortage
of oxygen</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0"> for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.</p>
</font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
<p>How the Snore Eliminator works!</p>
</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">
<p>Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all </font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">natural
enzymes</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0"> which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also</font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">
reduces the noise</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040"> made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping</font><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0">.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the<b> </b></font><b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#800040">throat
a chance to relax</font></b><font FACE="MS Sans Serif" COLOR="#0000a0"> thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.</p>

<p>Lorenzo writes...</p>
<p>I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.</p>
<p>PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.</p>
<p>Alex writes...</p>
<p>My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.</p>

<p>In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.</p>

Dear Friends & Future Millionaire: 

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: 
Making over half million monetary units every 4 to 5 months from your home for 
an investment of only $25 U.S. Notes expense one time 
THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! 

================================================== 

BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! 

Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you 
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of 
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted 
an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see 
if it really can make people assets. The show also investigated whether or 
not the program was legal. 

Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws 
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the 
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF 
POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, 
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. 

This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this beneficial opportunity. I 
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and assets required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with assets still coming in." 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. 

=================================================== 

Here is another testimonial: "This program has been around for a long 
time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again 
in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple 
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the assets started to come in. 
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made 
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first,

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from 
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be 
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in 
case something happen to your computer. 

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is 
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority 
of your income. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see 
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been 
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their 
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the assets. But 
it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and 
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person 
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! 

========================================================== 

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with 
advertising your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide 
you with invaluable advertising information which includes how to send bulk 
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of gratis classified ads and much more. 
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 

==========================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will 
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's 
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% 
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded 
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 
e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and 
ordered Report # 2
. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. 

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails 
sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report 
# 5
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 
... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT 
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF ASSETS !
 
========================================================= 

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are 
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, 
many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING GRATIS ADS ON THE INTERNET 

======================================================= 

Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds 
of no charge places to advertise. Placing a lot of gratis ads on the Internet will 
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 
and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you 
must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
receivethe report. 

=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== 

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: 
Always send $5 loot (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Paper Invoices NOT 
accepted. Make sure the bread is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets 
of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME 
of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name 
and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ 

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: 

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, 
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU 
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the 
dough will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: 
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
of a Different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE 
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START 
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. 
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! 

====================================================== 

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS 
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you 
financial independence for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST 
A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more assets in the next 
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program 
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works 
exceedingly well as it is now. 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 
as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. 
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers 
you will reach. 
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! 

============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ 

"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
ledgerist with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good assets. 
When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored 
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I 
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on 
her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks 
she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received 
total $ 147,200.00 ........... all notes! I was shocked. I have joined Jody 
in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 

====================================================== 

''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my assets back''. '' I was 
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with 
orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about 
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a 
better investment with a faster return and so big." 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 

======================================================= 

''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered 
if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not 
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
assets came within 22 weeks." 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 

======================================================= 

''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy assets with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the assets started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total loot count was 
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.".

I am now receiving less BOMBS when I am on-line;therefore, I believe it is better than the last version.There is, though, one little agonizing message "Image Toolbar"that pops up every time you pass the mouse over an image.It asks whether you want to save or print the image. UGH,what a pest.Hurrah, you can get rid of the Image Toolbar. Justperform a Right Mouse Click over the Image Toolbar.It will allow you to disable the Image Toolbar forthis session or forever. If you want to re-establishthe Image Toolbar just go to the Internet OptionsControl Panel and you can turn the Image Toolbar back on.Remember, a right mouse click over any Windows Icon,Window, tool bar, the Desktop, and most other Windowsentities will list loads of information.

It is a bit slow loading as would be the case with so much animation.I guess it will always be slow with all that. I do not like pop up pages and therewas one that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but theanimation did not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work hasbeen put into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively,why don't you have your own domain? You ought to look into that.~~~~This is a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are funas well. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name anda host that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups).~~~~Hmm... too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don'tlike the wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedme for a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someof the links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbased or smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhere to go.~~~~This was a neat site.  The site was original and I could tell that Mrs. T certainlyseems to enjoy working on her site.  The graphics were pretty, or funny,depending on each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewas going from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedthe left rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.  Also, I thinkusing a sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did like howthe font color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.I don't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage, it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactive opinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothe site content helps when new visitors visit.On your home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.If you do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferent pictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepicture on each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website. Onyour articles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseof the background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehind that would work better.Look for a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have looked at morepages but I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.I went to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is much easierto deal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~This is an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not all of whichI visited - and it has something for every member of the family, however, mostof it is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play - goodfor smaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and I wouldrecommend this site for the whole family.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Help out the winner of the gratis website redesign by voting forYOUR favorite!You can help out Teddy at http://www.links4profit.com by taking alook at his site, then looking at the three new layouts Jana ofAkkaBay Designs http://AkkaBay.com has designed specificallyfor him.

Why we're "IN THE NEWS" Every gambler knows that the house always wins in =
the long run. 
As Steve Wynn once famously said, "the only way to make dough in a casino =
is to own one" 
 
"I made $73,589.00 in my first 6 months, and will double that this time ar=
ound" J.Barnes, Norfolk, VA 
 
"We believe our projections of Internet gambling revenues of $100 to $200 =
Billion domestically and 
$200-$400 Billion in the rest of the world is reasonable, even conservativ=
e." The Baker Report
 
"We didn't realize how many people in our area gambled on-line until we re=
ceived our first paper invoice for 
$39,789.54" Steve Rhodes, PA. 
 
"As an entertainer, I look at the Internet as the future venue for many fo=
rms of entertainment. It is a 
powerful way to bring fun and safe entertainment to millions of people at =
the same time."  
Country Singer and online casino owner, Kenny Rogers 
 
"I was amazed at the number of friends and family that are playing on my C=
asino, last month I earned over $11,400" 
Dave P. IL 
 
"There's no doubt you are dealing with hundreds of Billions of monetary units... =

  You want to make some assets? 


  I can put you in touch with over 200 million people at virtually no cost.

If you can you yield over $2,000,000.00 



  That's right, I have over 200 Million  Fresh  email 


addresses that I will sell for only $149. These are all 


fresh addresses that include almost every person 


on the Internet today, with no duplications. They are 


all sorted and ready to be mailed.  That is the best 


deal anywhere today!  Imagine selling a product for 


only $5 and getting only a 1% response.   That's  OVER


$10,000,000 IN YOUR POCKET !!! 


  Don't believe it? People are making that kind of 


assets right now by doing the same thing, that is 


why you get so much email from people selling you 


their product....it works!  I will even tell you how to 


mail them with easy to follow step-by-step 


instructions I include with every order. 


I will send you a copy of every law concerning 


email. It is easy to obey the law and make a 


fortune. These 200 Million email addresses are     


yours to keep, so you can use them over and 


over. They come on a collection of several CDs.  


  This offer is not for everyone. If you can not 


see the just how excellent the risk / reward ratio 


in this offer is then there is nothing I can do 


for you.  To make assets you must stop dreaming 


and TAKE ACTION.
